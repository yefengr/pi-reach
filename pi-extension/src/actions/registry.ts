/**
 * Plan/28 — ModelRegistry access for the action handlers.
 *
 * The host hands every extension a ready `ModelRegistry` on
 * `ExtensionContext.modelRegistry` — the same instance `AgentSession` uses
 * internally. That is the ONLY source we read.
 *
 * History (issue #112): this module used to build its own registry via
 * `ModelRegistry.create(AuthStorage.create())`. Both factories were removed
 * from `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` in pi 0.83, so the import crashed the
 * whole pi process on the first `model_set`/`list_models` from the app
 * (`undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AuthStorage.create')`, thrown from
 * the WebSocket line handler). Reading the registry off the live ctx drops the
 * dependency on that package's factory surface entirely, so a future breaking
 * change there cannot crash the extension the same way again.
 *
 * Two hazards this handles:
 *
 * 1. A ctx captured before a session replacement/reload is **stale**, and even
 *    *reading* `.modelRegistry` on it throws (`assertActive`). Every read is
 *    wrapped.
 * 2. There may be no live ctx at all while an Extension callback runs. Rather
 *    than throw from a WS callback — an uncaught exception that exits pi — we
 *    fall back to the last registry that worked, then to a stub whose methods
 *    never throw and report an empty catalog.
